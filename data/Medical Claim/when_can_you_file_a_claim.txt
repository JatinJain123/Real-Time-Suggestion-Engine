You can file a medical insurance claim in case of hospitalization due to illness, accident, or surgery.
Medical claims can be filed for cashless treatment at network hospitals or for reimbursement of medical expenses incurred at non-network hospitals.
You may also file a claim for pre- and post-hospitalization expenses if covered under your policy.
